# GIGAStrong

GIGAStrong is the project I will use to train my back-end coding abilities. 

(Mandatory) In the first stage, the application should work like a simple workout journal which has basic functionalities like creating a workout routine, creating a workout program, applying said program to a day of the week, adding exercises, adding target number of sets/reps. 
When starting and workout you will be able to log the values of sets, reps and weight and also start a "cooldown" timer for your breaks, between sets, which will also be logged.
You will be able to create an account using relevant information for this type of app (Age, Gender, Height, level of experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
When setting up a workout routine you will recieve sets/reps/weight suggestions based on the data of your profile. 

(Optional) In the second stage, advanced functions will be implemented, like tracking progress over a period of time and generating a graph, calculating the volume (KG's you lifted) over a period of time 

(Optional) In the final stage of the app, it will recieve a working UI.
